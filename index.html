        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP.
            Tim Berners-Lee (born June 8, 1955, London, England) British computer scientist, generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.

Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.

                <h3>Hyper Text Tranfer Protocol </h3>
                <p>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
                    It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
                    The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
                    This protocol is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol because of its efficiency that allows us to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another document. HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host. </p>

                <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
                <p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>
